# Contributing to Agentic Project Management (APM)

Thank you for considering contributing to APM! Your contributions help build a better framework for AI-assisted project management.

## Ways to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs & Workflow Issues

- **Search existing issues** first: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management/issues)
- **For new bug reports**, include:
  - APM CLI version (run `apm --version` or `npm list -g agentic-pm`)
  - Node.js and npm versions (run `node --version` and `npm --version`)
  - AI IDE used (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, etc.)
  - Specific agent type experiencing issues (Planner, Manager, Worker, Delegate)
  - Step-by-step reproduction of the issue (if possible - otherwise a detailed description will suffice)
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Relevant context (memory system variant, asset format, etc.)

### Suggesting Features & Improvements

- Framework enhancements: New agent capabilities, workflow improvements, memory system optimizations
- Documentation improvements: Clearer explanations, additional examples, missing use cases
- New integrations: Support for additional AI IDEs, tools, or platforms
- Performance optimizations: Token efficiency, context management, handover procedures

**Before requesting new features or changes to workflow assets (prompts/guides):** Please review [Modifying_APM.md](docs/Modifying_APM.md) for guidance on customizing APM for your needs using a custom repo template.

### Documentation Contributions

APM includes comprehensive documentation, and contributions to improve it are always welcome. Please note that documentation changes are treated with extra care to ensure clarity, accuracy, and consistency across the framework.

### High-Priority Areas Seeking Contributions:

**Delegate Skills**
- Specialized skills for context-intensive tasks beyond debugging and research
- Examples needed: Testing automation, security analysis, data extraction, documentation generation, performance optimization
- Resources: `templates/skills/` directory (skill patterns and guidelines)
- Format: Follow existing Debug/Research skill structure

**Project Breakdown Optimization**
- Plans generated by the current skills are sufficient but can sometimes be inefficient. Seeking contributions to refine the Project Breakdown procedure and reduce token usage without sacrificing clarity or quality.
- Resources: `templates/skills/`, [`docs/Workflow_Overview.md`](docs/Workflow_Overview.md)
- Contributions needed: Lightweight patterns, skill refinements, practical examples, and validation benchmarks.

**Template Standards**
- Help improve the template authoring standards in `templates/_standards/`
- Resources: TERMINOLOGY.md, STRUCTURE.md, WRITING.md
- Contributions needed: Additional guidelines, examples, and best practices for consistent template development.

### Community Contributions

- Share adaptations: Domain-specific customizations (web dev, data science, content creation)
- IDE integrations: Platform-specific rules, configurations, or workflows  
- Best practices: Cost optimization strategies, effective agent coordination patterns
- Case studies: Real project examples using APM

## Contribution Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/agentic-project-management.git
   cd agentic-project-management
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/description-of-change
   ```

4. **Install website dependencies (if working on documentation):**
   ```bash
   cd website
   npm install
   ```

### Troubleshooting Website Build Issues

#### Search Plugin Compatibility

The Docusaurus website uses `@easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local` for search functionality. This plugin may fail to load on some environments (particularly Windows/WSL) due to missing `File` API support in certain Node.js contexts.

**If you encounter build errors related to the search plugin:**

- **The build will automatically skip the plugin** if it fails to load, showing a warning instead of crashing. The website will build successfully without search functionality.
- **To manually disable the search plugin**, set the environment variable:
  ```bash
  DISABLE_SEARCH_PLUGIN=true npm run build
  ```
- **Note:** The plugin works correctly on:
  - macOS and Linux (most configurations)
  - GitHub Actions/Pages (Node.js 20 on Ubuntu)

If you experience issues, the build will continue without search functionality. This is expected behavior and does not indicate a problem with your changes.

### Making Changes

APM v0.5 uses a build system that processes source files into distributable assets. Understanding where to make changes is crucial:

#### File Locations

- **Commands:** Edit files in `templates/commands/` for agent initiation and handoff prompts.
- **Skills:** Edit files in `templates/skills/` for procedural skills (project breakdown, delegation, etc.).
- **Core Artifacts:** Edit files in `templates/apm/` for APM's core artifacts and memory system templates.
- **Writing Standards:** Edit files in `templates/_standards/` for template authoring guidelines (TERMINOLOGY.md, STRUCTURE.md, WRITING.md).
- **CLI Tool Code:** Edit JavaScript files in the `src/` directory for changes to the CLI tool's core functionality.
- **Build System:** Edit files in the `build/` directory for build processors and configuration.
- **Documentation:** Edit files in the `docs/` directory for framework documentation updates.

> #### Build Process
>
> **Note:** After modifying files in `templates/`, you must run the build script to generate the distributable files:
>
>```bash
> npm run build:release
>```
>
> This command processes the source templates and creates platform-specific bundles in the `dist/` directory.

#### Making Your Changes

1. Edit the relevant files in `templates/` (for prompts/guides) or `src/` (for CLI code).
2. Follow existing file structure and naming conventions.
3. Run the build script: `npm run build`
4. Test your changes (see Testing section below).
5. Update relevant documentation in the `docs/` directory if needed.

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting your contribution, ensure your changes work correctly:

**For CLI or build system changes** (`src/` or `build/` directories):
- Run `npm run build:release` to verify the build completes successfully
- Test your changes manually by running CLI commands locally
- Verify the generated output in `dist/` is correct

**For template changes** (`templates/` directory):
- Run `npm run build:release` to generate the distributable files
- Test your changes with actual AI assistants locally
- You are encouraged (but not required) to include example assistant interactions or exported chat logs in your PR to speed review

**Be sure your changes are rigorously tested before submitting:** include clear test instructions in your PR, list the AI assistant(s) and configurations used, and provide step-by-step reproduction steps. Maintainers will perform additional validation prior to merging.

### Pull Requests

1. Ensure your changes are properly tested.
2. Commit with clear messages: `git commit -m 'Add: [specific improvement]'`
3. Push your branch: `git push origin feature/description-of-change`
4. Create a Pull Request (PR) with a clear description of your changes and reference any relevant issue numbers.

### PR Requirements

- Provide a clear description of changes and motivation.
- Reference related issues if applicable.
- Include test instructions when relevant (especially for prompts/guides).
- Update documentation for user-facing changes.
- Follow established patterns in existing APM assets.

### Versioning Considerations

APM uses a decoupled versioning system where the CLI and templates version independently but share the same major version number:

* **CLI Changes (`src/`):** If your contribution modifies the CLI code and warrants a new release, consider adding one of the labels `release:patch`, `release:minor`, or `release:major` to your Pull Request. The presence of one of these labels will trigger the automatic version bump and NPM publish workflow.<br/>
* **Template Changes (`templates/`):** Templates now version independently from the CLI. After your PR is merged, a maintainer will manually trigger the template release workflow with appropriate version increments. Template versions share the same major version as the CLI for compatibility.
* **Build System Changes (`build/`):** Changes to build processors or configuration do not trigger version bumps or releases.

Please refer to [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) for a complete explanation of the decoupled release strategy. Ensure your contributions align with this process.
