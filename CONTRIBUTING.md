# Contributing to Agentic Project Management (APM)

Thank you for considering contributing to APM! Your contributions help build a better framework for AI-assisted project management.

## Ways to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs & Workflow Issues

- **Search existing issues** first: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management/issues)
- **For new bug reports**, include:
  - APM CLI version (run `apm --version` or `npm list -g agentic-pm`)
  - Node.js and npm versions (run `node --version` and `npm --version`)
  - AI IDE used (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, etc.)
  - Specific agent type experiencing issues (Setup, Manager, Implementation, Ad-Hoc)
  - Step-by-step reproduction of the issue (if possible - otherwise a detailed description will suffice)
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Relevant context (memory system variant, asset format, etc.)

### Suggesting Features & Improvements

- Framework enhancements: New agent capabilities, workflow improvements, memory system optimizations
- Documentation improvements: Clearer explanations, additional examples, missing use cases
- New integrations: Support for additional AI IDEs, tools, or platforms
- Performance optimizations: Token efficiency, context management, handover procedures

**Before requesting new features or changes to workflow assets (prompts/guides):** Please review [Modifying_APM.md](docs/Modifying_APM.md) for guidance on customizing APM for your needs using a custom repo template.

### Documentation Contributions

APM v0.4 includes comprehensive documentation, and contributions to improve it are always welcome. Please note that documentation changes are treated with extra care to ensure clarity, accuracy, and consistency across the framework.

### High-Priority Areas Seeking Contributions:

**Ad-Hoc Delegation Guides**
- Specialized guides for context-intensive tasks beyond debugging and research
- Examples needed: Testing automation, security analysis, data extraction, documentation generation, performance optimization
- Resources: `templates/ad-hoc/` directory (template patterns and guidelines)
- Format: Follow existing Debug/Research delegation guide structure

**Project Breakdown Procedure Optimization**
- Plans generated by the current guide are sufficient but can sometimes be inefficient. Seeking contributions to refine the Project Breakdown procedure and reduce token usage without sacrificing clarity or quality.
- Resources: `templates/guides/Project_Breakdown_Guide.md`, [`docs/Workflow_Overview.md`](docs/Workflow_Overview.md)
- Contributions needed: Lightweight patterns, guide refinements, practical examples, and validation benchmarks.

### Community Contributions

- Share adaptations: Domain-specific customizations (web dev, data science, content creation)
- IDE integrations: Platform-specific rules, configurations, or workflows  
- Best practices: Cost optimization strategies, effective agent coordination patterns
- Case studies: Real project examples using APM

## Contribution Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/agentic-project-management.git
   cd agentic-project-management
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/description-of-change
   ```

### Making Changes

APM v0.5 uses a build system that processes source files into distributable assets. Understanding where to make changes is crucial:

#### File Locations

- **Prompts and Guides:** Edit Markdown files in the `templates/` directory. This is where all agent prompts, delegation guides, and workflow guides are maintained.
- **CLI Tool Code:** Edit JavaScript files in the `src/` directory for changes to the CLI tool's core functionality.
- **Documentation:** Edit files in the `docs/` directory for framework documentation updates.

> #### Build Process
>
> **Note:** After modifying files in `templates/`, you must run the build script to generate the distributable files:
>
>```bash
> npm run build
>```
>
> This command processes the source templates and creates platform-specific bundles in the `dist/` directory.

#### Making Your Changes

1. Edit the relevant files in `templates/` (for prompts/guides) or `src/` (for CLI code).
2. Follow existing file structure and naming conventions.
3. Run the build script: `npm run build`
4. Test your changes (see Testing section below).
5. Update relevant documentation in the `docs/` directory if needed.

### Testing Your Changes

#### Unit Tests

If your contribution affects the CLI or build script functionality (for example edits to files in `src/` or in `scripts/`), make sure you thoroughly test your changes. Run the automated test suite to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality:

```bash
npm test
```

For continuous testing during development:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

> **Note:** If your changes introduce new functionality, consider enhancing the test suite with unit tests for the feature (cover typical, edge, and failure cases), add any new test files under the project's test directory, and ensure they run with `npm test`.

#### Manual testing of template changes

If your contribution modifies prompt or guide templates, you must verify the changes by testing them with actual AI assistants locally. You do not have to include example assistant interactions or exported chat logs in your PR, **but you are encouraged to provide them when available to speed review.**

**Be sure your changes are rigorously tested before submitting:** include clear test instructions in the PR, list the AI assistant(s) and configurations used, provide step‑by‑step reproduction steps etc. Maintainers will still perform additional validation of prompt behavior prior to merging.

### Pull Requests

1. Ensure your changes are properly tested.
2. Commit with clear messages: `git commit -m 'Add: [specific improvement]'`
3. Push your branch: `git push origin feature/description-of-change`
4. Create a Pull Request (PR) with a clear description of your changes and reference any relevant issue numbers.

### PR Requirements

- Provide a clear description of changes and motivation.
- Reference related issues if applicable.
- Include test instructions when relevant (especially for prompts/guides).
- Update documentation for user-facing changes.
- Follow established patterns in existing APM assets.

### Versioning Considerations

APM has a dual versioning system: the CLI (`src/`) follows SemVer on NPM, while Templates (`templates/`) use build metadata (`+templates.N`) released via GitHub Releases.

* **CLI Changes (`src/`):** If your contribution modifies the CLI code and warrants a new release, consider addign one of the labels `release:patch`, `release:minor`, or `release:major` to your Pull Request. The presence of one of these labels will trigger the automatic version bump and NPM publish workflow.<br/>
   > **Note:** PRs with a `release:x` label will receive extra scrutiny from maintainers, including a thorough review of code, tests, and docs for stability and standards. If the label is missing on a PR that adds major or new CLI features, maintainers may add it to trigger the correct versioning and release process.
* **Template Changes (`templates/`):** Changes here do not automatically bump the CLI version. After your PR is merged, a maintainer will manually trigger the template release workflow, which creates a new Git tag (e.g., `vX.Y.Z+templates.N`) and a GitHub Release with the updated template bundles.
* **Build System Changes:** Changes to build scripts or configuration do not trigger version bumps or releases.

Please refer to [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) for a complete explanation of the release strategy. Ensure your contributions align with this process.
